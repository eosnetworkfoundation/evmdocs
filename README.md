# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Trust

## Introdution

Trust is an Ethereum Virtual Machine based on the EOS network, offering a turn-key solution for developers to operate their apps on an full Ethereum-compatible chain while enjoying the high throughput, scalability, security and reliability from EOS, with low transaction costs for their users.



Thanks to the high compatibility coming from the design, Ethereum native applications can seamlessly be ported to Trust. Developers may enjoy familiar Ethereum tooling when working with their Solidity smart contracts here.

## Key Features[â€‹](https://docs.avax.network/#key-features) <a href="#key-features" id="key-features"></a>



#### Performance[â€‹](https://docs.avax.network/#speed) <a href="#speed" id="speed"></a>

Utilizing EOS' industry-leading transaction speeds and the sub-second block time latency rate, the Trust EVM can offer second level block speed and high throughput.

#### Security and Reliability[â€‹](https://docs.avax.network/#security) <a href="#security" id="security"></a>

Implemented as a carefully audited smart contract on the EOS network, the Trust EVM leverages the time tested EOS network to achieve high security and reliability standard.&#x20;

#### Sustainability[â€‹](https://docs.avax.network/#sustainability) <a href="#sustainability" id="sustainability"></a>

Based on energy-efficient EOS network rather than proof-of-work.

#### Smart Contract Support[â€‹](https://docs.avax.network/#smart-contract-support) <a href="#smart-contract-support" id="smart-contract-support"></a>

Supports the creation of Solidity smart contracts and your favorite Ethereum tools like Remix, Metamask, Truffle, and more.

#### High API Compatibility

The architecture of the Trust EVM is designed in a way that prioritize compatibility. APIs such as RPC, GraphQL, etc. are available in the beginning.
