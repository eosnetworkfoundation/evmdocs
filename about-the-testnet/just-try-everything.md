# Just try everything!

The Trust Testnet is currently under developer preview phase. There's still a lot of improvement under way but the whole system is mostly working. To try everything about the Trust EVM:

* Connecting to the network with your favorite wallets.&#x20;
* Get some test tokens from the faucet.
* Make some transfers.
* Setting up IDEs to play with smart contracts!



Thanks to the high API compatibility of the Trust, most popular wallets and IDEs should work on Trust EVM seamlessly.&#x20;

Necessary information for connecting to the network can be found at [connect-metamask.md](connect-metamask.md) and/or [resources.md](resources.md).
