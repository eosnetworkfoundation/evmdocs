The Trust Network Testnet Preview connection details follow:

* `Network Name`: Trust Network Testnet Preview
* `Chain ID`: 15555
* `New RPC URL`: https://api.testnet-dev.trust.one
* `Currency Symbol`: EVM
* `Block Explorer URL (Optional)`: https://trustscan.one

Alternative endpoints can be found at [resources.md](resources.md)

Yet another way is to find the network you want to connect to at [Chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/), and you can add the configuration to your wallet through that service.
